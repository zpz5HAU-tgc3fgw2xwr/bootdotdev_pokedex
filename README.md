# Pok√©dex CLI üåê

Welcome to the Pok√©dex CLI! This is a TypeScript-based command-line interface project built as part of the [Boot.dev learning course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-pokedex-cli-typescript). Designed as an educational tool, this project demonstrates a variety of modern development practices while also serving as a fun way to interact with Pok√©mon data.

---

## Features üîó

- **Interactive CLI**: Perform tasks like catching Pok√©mon, inspecting details, and exploring locations.
- **Pok√©API Integration**: Dynamically fetch data about Pok√©mon, locations, and stats from [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).
- **State Management**: Maintain an in-memory state for user actions and a dynamic Pok√©dex.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle edge cases like invalid input or API failures.
- **Caching**: Reduce redundant API calls with a lightweight cache system.
- **Randomized Outcomes**: Simulate real-world mechanics with probabilistic Pok√©mon catching.

---

## Key Technologies üìä

- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **Node.js**: Provides the runtime for the CLI.
- **Vitest**: Comprehensive unit tests to validate the reliability and functionality of the codebase.
- **Pok√©API**: A RESTful API used to retrieve live Pok√©mon data.
- **ESM Modules**: Implements the latest ECMAScript standards for modular JavaScript.
