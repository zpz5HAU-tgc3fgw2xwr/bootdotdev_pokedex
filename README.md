# 🐌 Pokédex CLI (TypeScript)

This repository contains the **Pokédex CLI** project, developed as part of the [Boot.dev course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-pokedex-cli-typescript). The goal of this project is to build an interactive command-line interface for managing a Pokédex, showcasing TypeScript and CLI development skills.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive CLI**: Navigate, explore, and interact with your Pokédex directly from the terminal.
- **Pokémon Management**: Add, inspect, and view Pokémon details seamlessly.
- **API Integration**: Fetch Pokémon data dynamically from an external API.
- **Stateful Design**: Maintain Pokédex state across multiple commands.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully manage invalid inputs and API errors.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Core language for development.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for the CLI.
- **CLI Design**: Implementing an interactive command-line experience.
- **Testing**: Unit tests with Vitest.

## 📖 What I Learned

- Building a CLI tool from scratch in TypeScript.
- Managing application state effectively within a command-line interface.
- Integrating with external APIs to fetch and process data.
- Writing clean, maintainable, and testable TypeScript code.
- Handling errors gracefully in user-facing tools.

## 🧪 Testing

Unit tests were written to verify core functionality, including:

- Ensuring correct Pokédex updates when Pokémon are caught or inspected.
- Validating API integration and error handling.
- Simulating CLI commands to test user interactions.

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```

## 🌟 Why This Project?

The Pokédex CLI project was built to:

- Strengthen TypeScript proficiency.
- Learn best practices in CLI tool design and user experience.
- Gain practical experience with API integration and data handling.
- Showcase skills in testing and error management for robust applications.
